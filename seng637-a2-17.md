# 1 Introduction

In this lab, we conducted JUnit Testing on 2 classes of an open-source Java framework for chart calculation, creation, and display, called JFreeChart. The classes tested were DataUtilities, of which all its methods were tested, and Range, of which five out of fifteen of its methods were chosen for testing. Since some methods in the DataUtilities class rely on other interfaces, Values2D and KeyedValues, we used Mocking, specifically the JMock library to represent these external dependencies.

In this report, we will go through our test plan that we created prior to conducting the testing. This test plan covers the unit test strategy and the black-box testing techniques we used to design the test cases. After that, we will show how we implemented our unit test strategy in the test cases we created.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

Since we do not have knowledge of the how any of the methods work, we used black-box testing techniques in our unit test strategy. First, we read the JavaDoc for the DataUtilities and Range classes. We read the specifications for each of the methods and we picked the 5 methods we wanted to test from the Range class. For each method in each class, this is the test strategy we followed:

1. Divide each parameter into 2 equivalence classes - valid and invalid.
2. Within each of these top-level classes, further divide the parameters into more specific classes.
3. For each class, pick a value at the boundary between classes (boundary value analysis).
4. Remove any redundant classes.
5. Review the test cases for the method, and add any additional test cases that may have been missed.

In the following section, we will show the test cases we developed using this testing strategy.

# 3 Test cases developed

### DataUtilities Class

Using the test strategy from section 2, we designed the following test cases for the DataUtilities methods.

For methods 1, 2 and 5 in the DataUtilities class, we used mocking to represent the Values2D and KeyedValues interfaces. The benefit of using mocking is that allows you to test the method in question without interference from external dependencies. Since we are only testing the functionality of the DataUtilities class, it does not matter if the external interfaces, Values2D and KeyedValues, that this class depends on operate correctly. Instead, we are able to specify what values we want the interfaces to return, without any knowledge of how they work or if they work correctly, and use these values to test the class in question. A major drawback of this, however, is that it does not simulate real-word performance of the DataUtilities class since the behavior of the external dependencies is manipulated and simulated. Additional unit testing of the Values2D and KeyedValues interfaces should be done to ensure the behavior is as we expected and simulated.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

We came up with the test strategy in section 2 of this report together as a group to ensure that we all follow the same techniques in coming up with the test cases and that we cover a wide range of test cases for each method. After that, we split the 10 methods (5 from each class) amongst the group, each member creating test cases for 2 methods. We had each group member test one method from each class. Once we completed designing the test cases, we reviewed them as a group and discussed changes we wanted to make. After finalizing the test cases on paper, we each implemented the test cases for the methods we were originally assigned. We split the methods as follows:

### DataUtilities Class

1. calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column) - Brandon
2. calculateRowTotal(Values2D data, int row) - Mustayeen
3. createNumberArray(double[] data) - Kate
4. createNumberArray2D(double\[][] data) - Mevin
5. getCumulativePercentages(KeyedValues data) - Nur-Alhuda

### Range Class

1. constrain(double value) - Kate
2. expandToInclude(Range range, double value) - Mustayeen
3. shift(Range base, double delta, boolean allowZeroCrossing) - Nur-Alhuda
4. contains(double value) - Mevin
5. combine(Range range1, Range range2) - Brandon

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

A major difficulty that we encountered was having gaps in our test cases due to splitting up the work amongst the team. To overcome this, we had a group discussion after each member had completed designing their test cases for their assigned methods to determine any gaps in our test cases and add additional test cases as needed. Another challenge we encountered was different naming for the test cases since we split the methods amongst the group - each person had a different way of naming their test cases. We solved this issue by having one person go through all the test cases and unifying the naming. Because of this, we learned the importance of code reviews and group discussions.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

This lab was very effective in giving us a solid foundation for unit testing and mocking.
